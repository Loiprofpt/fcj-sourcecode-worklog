> This section reflects my personal opinions and experience as a **Learning Intern at AWS Vietnam**, based on the internship program. These insights can help the company improve the program for future interns.

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS Vietnam is very friendly, open, and professional. Team members are always willing to assist when I encounter challenges, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which helps me focus on my tasks. I believe adding more social gatherings or team-building activities could further strengthen relationships among interns and employees.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided clear and detailed guidance, encouraged me to solve problems independently, and always welcomed questions. The admin team efficiently supported administrative tasks, provided necessary documents, and created favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate the mentor's approach of letting me try solutions myself rather than simply giving answers.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks assigned to me were closely related to my academic knowledge, while also introducing me to new topics I had not encountered before. This allowed me to strengthen my foundational skills and gain practical experience in cloud computing, security practices, and project workflows.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills, including using project management tools, collaborating effectively within a team, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared real-world insights that helped me better understand industry standards and plan my career development.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is highly positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously, but maintains a friendly and approachable atmosphere. During urgent projects, team members collaborate efficiently and support one another regardless of hierarchy. This made me feel like a valued part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
AWS Vietnam provides a fair internship allowance and flexible working hours when necessary. Additionally, the opportunity to join internal training sessions was extremely valuable for enhancing technical knowledge and professional skills.

### Additional Questions

**Q2: What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
Providing more structured onboarding for new interns, including an overview of AWS internal tools and workflows, would help interns adapt faster. Additionally, organizing occasional social events or networking sessions could strengthen engagement and interaction.

**Q3: If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
Yes, I would definitely recommend this internship. The program offers valuable technical exposure, professional mentorship, and a supportive working environment that helps interns grow their skills and confidence in real-world projects.
