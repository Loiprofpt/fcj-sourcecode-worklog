  - Modern IAM architecture: Users, Roles, Policies, and avoiding long-term credentials.  
  - IAM Identity Center for SSO and permission sets.  
  - Permission boundaries & Service Control Policies (SCPs).  
  - MFA, access analysis, and credential rotation.  
  - Mini demo: IAM policy validation and access simulation.  

- **Pillar 2 — Detection & Monitoring**  
  - Using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub for continuous monitoring.  
  - Logging layers: VPC Flow Logs, ALB logs, S3 logs.  
  - Automation with EventBridge.  
  - Detection-as-Code implementation.  

- **Pillar 3 — Infrastructure Protection**  
  - Network segmentation strategies.  
  - Security Groups vs NACLs.  
  - WAF, Shield, and Network Firewall best practices.  
  - Workload protection basics for EC2, ECS, and EKS.
