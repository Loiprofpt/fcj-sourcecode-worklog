**On this page** you will find a concise summary of my 12-week internship. Over the three-month period I studied cloud technologies and applied them to build a practical IoT solution. The program combined weekly learning objectives with hands-on tasks, and it culminated in a field-ready IoT system for detecting alcohol-related traffic violations.

Weekly summary of activities and focus areas:

- **Week 1:** Familiarized myself with core AWS services and the management console. ([details](1.1-week1/))
- **Week 2:** Studied VPC concepts and network setup in AWS. ([details](1.2-week2/))
- **Week 3:** Practiced EC2 instance setup, security groups, and instance management. ([details](1.3-week3/))
- **Week 4:** Explored AWS storage options (S3, EBS) and practiced the AWS CLI for automation. ([details](1.4-week4/))
- **Week 5:** Learned AWS security best practices (IAM, Cognito, Organizations, KMS). ([details](1.5-week5/))
- **Week 6:** Studied microservice architecture, gRPC and Kafka, and contributed to group architecture diagrams. ([details](1.6-week6/))
- **Week 7:** Practiced AWS Lambda and API Gateway by deploying serverless functions and building simple APIs. ([details](1.7-week7/))
- **Week 8:** Completed a group proposal, reviewed system architecture and cost/performance considerations, and took the midterm exam. ([details](1.8-week8/))
- **Week 9:** Worked with AWS IoT Core and Amplify to prepare device-cloud integration for the project. ([details](1.9-week9/))
- **Week 10:** Learned Terraform and GitHub Actions to prepare repeatable infrastructure and automation for deployments. ([details](1.10-week10/))
- **Week 11:** Focused on IoT hardware: procured sensors and ESP32 modules, developed embedded firmware, and prepared the device-to-cloud data flow for alcohol detection. ([details](1.11-week11/))
- **Week 12:** Finalized firmware and calibration for the alcohol sensor, validated end-to-end detection and reporting, performed the final demonstration, and compiled the final documentation and worklog. ([details](1.12-week12/))
